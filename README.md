==========

simple game/ ai test for an ecosystem - look for test 2 soon!
---------------------------

Little villagers are spawned on both sides of the map and compete for resources
usually they cut down all the forests and the guys just collect food after a while

***note - the codebase sets a limit on total bases and trees - feel free to remove for fun and excitement! ***

Villagers...
  - cut down trees
  - tend to fields
  - harvest veggies

Trees...
  - grow up to a certain point, then produce saplings
  - saplings grow in the general direction of the forest in which their parent tree lives (expanding outward)
  - will stop growing if cut too much by villagers

Fields...
  - slowly will go from dirt to filled with ripe food
  - if a villager tends to a field, it will grow more quickly
